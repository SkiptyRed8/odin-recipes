    <h3>How to Cook</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Ingredients – Cut the meat into serving pieces and mince the garlic. </li>
        <li>Marinate the Meat – In a bowl, combine the meat, soy sauce, and half of the garlic. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for better flavor)..</li>
        <li>Sauté the Garlic – Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and sauté the remaining garlic until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Brown the Meat – Add the marinated meat to the pan (without the marinade first) and cook until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add the Marinade and Spices – Pour in the marinade, then add vinegar, bay leaves, black peppercorns, and water. Do not stir yet.</li>
        <li>Simmer Until Tender – Cover and let it simmer over low heat for about 30–40 minutes or until the meat is tender. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed.        </li>
        <li>Adjust Flavor – Taste and add sugar or salt if desired. Let it simmer for a few more minutes to blend the flavors.</li>
        <li>Reduce the Sauce – If you prefer a thicker sauce, let it cook uncovered for a few more minutes until the sauce is slightly reduced.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy – Remove from heat and serve hot with steamed rice!</li>
